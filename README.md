One of my project within Progmatic Academy course.

User could navigate from landing page click on to read more button to the blog details where could find a detailed story and comments.

As well could create comments on comment form and could submit that.

On footer click on contact as well find a form after fill it also can submit the datas.

I mocked out the backend and I used REST API.
